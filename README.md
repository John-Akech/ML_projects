#  Sonar Rock vs Mine Classifier

This project uses machine learning to classify sonar signals as either **rocks** or **mines**, based on frequency-based features. It demonstrates a complete **end-to-end ML pipeline** — from data cleaning and exploration to model tuning, evaluation, and web app deployment.



##  Project Overview

-  **Goal:** Predict whether a sonar return indicates a **rock** or a **mine**.
-  Dataset: 208 samples, 60 frequency-based features, labeled as `M` (mine) or `R` (rock).
-  Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning).
-  Deployed using **Streamlit** for a simple and interactive web interface.
